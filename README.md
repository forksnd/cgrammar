# C23 grammar for parser generators

This is a C23 grammar extracted from draft written in a way parser generators can understand. 
The grammar is described with almost 1:1 syntax. [grammar.txt](grammar.txt)

Some diferences:

Bold text in the draft is replaced with quotes.

opt sufix is replaced with opt separated from the previous prodution name.
So opt is a reserved name, working as operator.

/*C comments are*/ used.
